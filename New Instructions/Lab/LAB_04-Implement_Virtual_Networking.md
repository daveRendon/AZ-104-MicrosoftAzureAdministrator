# Lab 04 - Implement Virtual Networking

## Lab introduction

This lab is the first of three labs that focuses on virtual networking. In this lab, you learn the basics of virtual networking and subnetting. You also learn how to protect your network with network security groups and application security groups. 

This lab requires an Azure subscription. Your subscription type may affect the availability of features in this lab. You may change the region, but the steps are written using **East US**.

## Estimated time: 40 minutes

## Lab scenario 

Your global organization plans to implement virtual networks. These networks are in East US, West Europe, and Southeast Asia. The immediate goal is to accommodate all the existing resources. However, the organization is in a growth phase and wants to ensure there is additional capacity for the growth.

The **CoreServicesVnet** virtual network is deployed in the **East US** region. This virtual network has the largest number of resources.  A large amount of growth is anticipated, so a large address space is necessary for this virtual network.

The **ManufacturingVnet** virtual network is also deployed in the **East US** region, near the location of your organization's manufacturing facilities. This virtual network contains systems for the operations of the manufacturing facilities. The organization is anticipating a large number of internal connected devices for their systems to retrieve data from. 

## Interactive lab simulations

There are several interactive lab simulations that you might find useful for this topic. The simulation lets you to click through a similar scenario at your own pace. There are differences between the interactive simulation and this lab, but many of the core concepts are the same. An Azure subscription is not required.

These virtual networks and subnets are structured in a way that accommodates existing resources yet allows for the projected growth. Let's create these virtual networks and subnets to lay the foundation for our networking infrastructure.

>**Did you know?**: It is a good practice to avoid overlapping IP address ranges to reduce issues and simplify troubleshooting. Overlapping is a concern across the entire network, whether in the cloud or on-premises. Many organizations design an enterprise-wide IP addressing scheme to avoid overlapping and plan for future growth.

## Tasks

+ Task 1: Create the CoreServicesVnet virtual network and subnets.
+ Task 2: Create the ManufacturingVnet virtual network and subnets.
+ Task 3: Configure communication between an Application Security Group and a Network Security Group. 

  
## Task 1: Create the CoreServicesVnet virtual network and subnets

The organization plans a large amount of growth for core services. In this task, you create the virtual network and the associated subnets to accommodate the existing resources and planned growth.

1. Search for and select `Virtual Networks`.

1. Select **Create** on the Virtual networks page and complete the **Basics** and **IP addresses** tabs. 

1. Use the information in the following table to create the CoreServicesVnet virtual network.  

	| **Tab**      | **Option**         | **Value**            |
	| ------------ | ------------------ | -------------------- |
	| Basics       | Resource Group     | **az104-rg4** |
	|              | Name               | `CoreServicesVnet`     |
	|              | Region             | (US) **East US**         |
	| IP Addresses | IPv4 address space | `10.20.0.0/16` (separate the entries)    |


1. Select **+ Add a subnet**. Complete the name and address information for each subnet. Be sure to select **Add** for each new subnet. 

	| **Subnet**             | **Option**           | **Value**              |
	| ---------------------- | -------------------- | ---------------------- |
	| SharedServicesSubnet   | Subnet name          | `SharedServicesSubnet`   |
	|                        | Starting address		| `10.20.10.0`          |
	|						 | Size					| `/24`	|
	| DatabaseSubnet         | Subnet name          | `DatabaseSubnet`         |
	|                        | Starting address		| `10.20.20.0`        |
	|						 | Size					| `/24`	|

>**Note:** Every virtual network must have at least one subnet. Reminder that five IP addresses will always be reserved, so consider that in your planning. 

1. To finish creating the CoreServicesVnet and its associated subnets, select **Review + create**.

1. Verify your configuration passed validation, and then select **Create**.

1. Wait for the virtual network to deploy and then select **Go to resource**.

1. Take a minute to verify the **Address space** and the **Subnets**. Notice your other choices in the **Settings** blade. 

1. In the **Automation** section, select **Export template**, and then wait for the template to be generated.

1. **Download** the template.

1. Navigate on the local machine to the **Downloads** folder and **Extract all** the files in the downloaded zip file. 

1. Before proceeding ensure you have the **template.json** file. Take a minute to review the file and the information about the CoreServicesVnet. You will use this template to create the ManufacturingVnet in the next task. 
 
## Task 2: Create the ManufacturingVnet virtual network and subnets

In this task, you create the ManufacturingVnet virtual network and associated subnets. The organization anticipates growth for the manufacturing offices so the subnets are sized for the expected growth.

1. Locate the **template.json** file exported in the previous task. It should be in your **Downloads** folder.

1. Edit the file using the editor of your choice. If you are using Visual Studio Code be sure you are working in a **trusted window** and not in the **restricted mode**.

   >**Note:** For this task we are demonstrating how to edit and then redeploy a template. If it gets too confusing, the finished template is provided in the lab files. You could also just build the virtual network in the portal as you did in the previous task. 

### Make changes for the ManufacturingVnet virtual network

>**Note:** Use your editor of choice to make changes to the template files. Many editors have a *change all occurences* feature. Consult the architecture diagram to verify the details. 

1. Replace all occurrences of **CoreServicesVnet** with `ManufacturingVnet`. 

1. Replace all occurrences of **10.20.0.0/16** with `10.30.0.0/16`. 

### Make changes for the ManufacturingVnet subnets

1. Change all occurrences of **SharedServicesSubnet** to `SensorSubnet1`.

1. Change all occurrences of **10.20.10.0/24** to `10.30.20.0/24`.

1. Change all occurrences of **DatabaseSubnet** to `SensorSubnet2`.

## Key takeaways

Congratulations on completing the lab. Here are the main takeaways for this lab. 

+ A virtual network is a representation of your own network in the cloud. 
+ When designing virtual networks it is a good practice to avoid overlapping IP address ranges. This will reduce issues and simplify troubleshooting.
+ A subnet is a range of IP addresses in the virtual network. You can divide a virtual network into multiple subnets for organization and security.
+ A network security group contains security rules that allow or deny network traffic. There are default incoming and outgoing rules which you can customize to your needs.
+ Application security groups are used to protect groups of servers with a common function, such as web servers or database servers. 

## Learn more with self-paced training

+ [Introduction to Azure Virtual Networks](https://learn.microsoft.com/training/modules/introduction-to-azure-virtual-networks/). Design and implement core Azure Networking infrastructure such as virtual networks, public and private IPs, DNS, virtual network peering, routing, and Azure Virtual NAT.
+ [Secure and isolate access to Azure resources by using network security groups and service endpoints](https://learn.microsoft.com/training/modules/secure-and-isolate-with-nsg-and-service-endpoints/). Network security groups and service endpoints help you secure your virtual machines and Azure services from unauthorized network access.
  
## Cleanup your resources

If you are working with your own subscription take a minute to delete the lab resources. This will ensure resources are freed up and cost is minimized. The easiest way to delete the lab resources is to delete the lab resource group. 

+ In the Azure portal, select the resource group, select **Delete the resource group**, **Enter resource group name**, and then click **Delete**.
+ Using Azure PowerShell, `Remove-AzResourceGroup -Name resourceGroupName`.
+ Using the CLI, `az group delete --name resourceGroupName`.
